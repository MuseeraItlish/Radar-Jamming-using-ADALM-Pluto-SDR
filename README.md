## Overview:

This repository contains my internship project on implementing and analyzing radar and wireless jamming techniques using the ADALM-Pluto Software Defined Radio (SDR) with MATLAB and GNU Radio.
The work focuses on generating, transmitting, and visualizing different jamming signals and evaluating their effectiveness using practical performance metrics.
All experiments were conducted in controlled, low-power laboratory environments for academic and educational purposes only.# Radar-Jamming-using-ADALM-Pluto-SDR

## Objectives:

-Understand radar operation and electronic jamming concepts

-Implement multiple jamming techniques using SDR

-Transmit and receive real RF signals

-Analyze jamming performance using metrics like J/S ratio, duty cycle, and power control.


## Jamming Techniques Implemented:

-Gaussian Noise  – Wideband noise to raise receiver noise floor

-Spot Jamming – Narrowband single-tone interference

-Sweep Noise Jamming 

-Pseudo-Noise (PN) Jamming – BPSK-modulated deterministic noise

-Pulsed Noise Jamming – Randomized noise bursts for radar-like signals

## Experiments:

-Wi-Fi jamming (at 2.4 GHz)

-Radar-like pulsed signal jamming with J/S ratio analysis

-Over-the-air jamming using a Vector Signal Generator (VSG) and horn antenna

-Distance-based evaluation of spot vs wideband noise jamming
